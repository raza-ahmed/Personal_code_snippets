Converting a normal class into a Parcelable class

Why Parcelable?

#During the Android application development process, developers often have to send Java class objects from one activity to another activity using the intent. Developers can opt from the two types of object passing techniques, i.e. Serialization and Parcelable of object.  The fact that Parcelable is faster than Serialization makes it a preferred choice of approach while passing an object.
